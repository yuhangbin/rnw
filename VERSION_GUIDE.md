# Python Version Specifiers Guide

## Common Version Patterns

### Basic Patterns

| Pattern | Meaning | Example | Allows |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| `>=1.0.0` | Minimum version | `pytest>=7.0.0` | 7.0.0, 7.1.0, 8.0.0, etc. |
| `==1.0.0` | Exact version | `pytest==7.0.0` | Only 7.0.0 |
| `~=1.0.0` | Compatible release | `pytest~=7.0.0` | 7.0.0, 7.0.1, 7.0.2 (not 7.1.0) |
| `>=1.0.0,<2.0.0` | Version range | `requests>=2.28.0,<3.0.0` | 2.28.0 to 2.99.x |

### Advanced Patterns

| Pattern | Meaning | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `>=1.0.0,!=1.2.0` | Exclude specific version | `pandas>=1.3.0,!=1.4.0` |
| `>=1.0.0,<2.0.0,!=1.5.0` | Range with exclusion | Complex compatibility |

## Real-World Examples

### Conservative Approach (Recommended for Libraries)
```toml
dependencies = [
    "requests>=2.28.0,<3.0.0",    # Stay in 2.x series
    "pandas>=1.3.0,<2.0.0",       # Avoid major version changes
    "numpy>=1.21.0,<2.0.0",       # Stable API within major version
]
```

### Flexible Approach (Good for Applications)
```toml
dependencies = [
    "requests>=2.28.0",           # Allow any newer version
    "pandas>=1.3.0",              # Trust semantic versioning
    "click>=8.0.0",               # CLI tools are usually stable
]
```

### Strict Approach (Use Sparingly)
```toml
dependencies = [
    "some-unstable-package==1.2.3",  # Only when absolutely necessary
]
```

## Why Each Approach Matters

### 🔒 **Exact Versions (`==1.0.0`)**
**When to use:**
- Package is known to be unstable
- You've tested extensively with one specific version
- Critical production system that can't risk any changes

**Problems:**
- Dependency conflicts
- No security updates
- No bug fixes
- Hard to maintain

### 📈 **Minimum Versions (`>=1.0.0`)**
**When to use:**
- You need features introduced in version 1.0.0
- You trust the package's semantic versioning
- You want latest features and security updates

**Benefits:**
- Always get latest features
- Automatic security updates
- Bug fixes included

**Risks:**
- Might get breaking changes
- New bugs in newer versions

### 🎯 **Version Ranges (`>=1.0.0,<2.0.0`)**
**When to use:**
- Best of both worlds approach
- Stay within a major version (semantic versioning)
- Production applications

**Benefits:**
- Get bug fixes and security updates
- Avoid breaking changes from major version bumps
- Flexible but safe

## Semantic Versioning Explained

Most Python packages follow semantic versioning (semver):

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
  2  . 28  . 0
```

- **MAJOR** - Breaking changes (2.x → 3.x)
- **MINOR** - New features, backward compatible (2.28 → 2.29)
- **PATCH** - Bug fixes, backward compatible (2.28.0 → 2.28.1)

### Safe Version Ranges Based on Semver

```toml
dependencies = [
    # Allow minor and patch updates, but not major
    "requests>=2.28.0,<3.0.0",     # 2.28.0 → 2.99.x ✅, 3.0.0 ❌
    
    # Allow only patch updates
    "critical-package>=1.5.0,<1.6.0",  # 1.5.0 → 1.5.x ✅, 1.6.0 ❌
    
    # Trust the package completely
    "well-maintained-package>=1.0.0",   # Any version ≥ 1.0.0
]
```

## Your Current Setup Analysis

Let's look at your dependencies:

```toml
dependencies = [
    "markitdown[all]>=0.0.1",   # ← Very permissive
]

dev = [
    "pytest>=7.0.0",            # ← Permissive
    "black>=22.0.0",            # ← Permissive
    "flake8>=5.0.0",            # ← Permissive
    "mypy>=1.0.0",              # ← Permissive
]
```

### Analysis:
- **Good:** You're using minimum versions, allowing updates
- **Risk:** Very permissive - might get breaking changes
- **Recommendation:** Add upper bounds for stability

## Recommended Improvements

### For Your Runtime Dependencies
```toml
dependencies = [
    # More conservative - stay within major versions
    "markitdown[all]>=0.0.1,<1.0.0",   # Stay in 0.x series
]
```

### For Your Dev Dependencies
```toml
dev = [
    "pytest>=7.0.0,<9.0.0",      # Allow 7.x and 8.x
    "black>=22.0.0,<25.0.0",     # Stay reasonably current
    "flake8>=5.0.0,<8.0.0",      # Stable linting
    "mypy>=1.0.0,<2.0.0",        # Type checking stability
]
```

## Practical Decision Framework

### Ask Yourself:

1. **How stable is this package?**
   - Stable → Use `>=x.y.z`
   - Unstable → Use `>=x.y.z,<x+1.0.0`

2. **How critical is this dependency?**
   - Critical → Use ranges `>=x.y.z,<x+1.0.0`
   - Non-critical → Use `>=x.y.z`

3. **Is this a library or application?**
   - Library → Be conservative (ranges)
   - Application → Can be more flexible

4. **Do you have good tests?**
   - Good tests → More flexible versions
   - Poor tests → More restrictive versions

## Common Patterns by Package Type

### Web Frameworks (Usually Stable)
```toml
"fastapi>=0.68.0,<1.0.0"      # Stay in 0.x until 1.0
"django>=4.0.0,<5.0.0"        # Major versions can have breaking changes
```

### Data Science (Evolving Rapidly)
```toml
"pandas>=1.3.0,<3.0.0"        # Allow 1.x and 2.x
"numpy>=1.21.0,<2.0.0"        # 2.0 will have breaking changes
```

### Development Tools (Usually Safe)
```toml
"pytest>=7.0.0"               # Generally backward compatible
"black>=22.0.0"               # Formatting is usually safe
```

## Testing Your Version Choices

```bash
# Check what versions are actually installed
pip list

# Check for outdated packages
pip list --outdated

# Test with different versions (in separate environments)
pip install "package>=1.0.0,<2.0.0"
# Run your tests
pytest
```

## Summary: Best Practices

1. **Default to ranges:** `>=x.y.z,<x+1.0.0`
2. **Trust semantic versioning:** Allow minor/patch updates
3. **Be more restrictive for critical dependencies**
4. **Be more flexible for development tools**
5. **Test regularly with updated dependencies**
6. **Use exact versions only when absolutely necessary**

Your current approach is good for getting started, but consider adding upper bounds for production stability!
