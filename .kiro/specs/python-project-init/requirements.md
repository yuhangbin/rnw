# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a Python project initialization system that sets up a basic Python project structure with a simple example module and corresponding unit tests. The system will provide developers with a quick way to bootstrap a new Python project with best practices including proper directory structure, example code, and testing framework setup.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to initialize a Python project with a standard structure, so that I can quickly start developing with best practices in place.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is initialized THEN the system SHALL create a proper Python package structure with __init__.py files
2. WHEN the project is initialized THEN the system SHALL create a setup.py or pyproject.toml file for package configuration
3. WHEN the project is initialized THEN the system SHALL create a requirements.txt file for dependency management
4. WHEN the project is initialized THEN the system SHALL create a README.md file with basic project information

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simple example module included in the project, so that I can see working Python code and understand the project structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is initialized THEN the system SHALL create an example module with at least one function
2. WHEN the example module is created THEN it SHALL include proper docstrings and type hints
3. WHEN the example module is created THEN it SHALL demonstrate basic Python functionality like string manipulation or mathematical operations
4. WHEN the example module is created THEN it SHALL follow PEP 8 style guidelines

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want unit tests for the example code, so that I can see how to write and run tests in the project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is initialized THEN the system SHALL create a tests directory with proper structure
2. WHEN unit tests are created THEN they SHALL test all functions in the example module
3. WHEN unit tests are created THEN they SHALL use the pytest framework
4. WHEN unit tests are created THEN they SHALL include both positive and negative test cases
5. WHEN unit tests are run THEN they SHALL all pass successfully

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the project to be immediately runnable, so that I can verify everything works correctly after initialization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is initialized THEN the system SHALL create a main.py file that demonstrates the example functionality
2. WHEN main.py is executed THEN it SHALL run without errors and produce expected output
3. WHEN tests are run using pytest THEN they SHALL execute successfully and show passing results
4. WHEN the project structure is created THEN it SHALL be compatible with common Python development tools and IDEs
